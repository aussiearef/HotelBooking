# Build Microservices with AWS 
# The Website


This HTML & Javascript website is part of two online courses called ["Build Microservices with .NET and Amazon Web Services"](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-microservices-with-aspnet-core-amazon-web-services/?referralCode=B288BF33506B34292176) and ["Master Event-Driven Microservices with Python and AWS"](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-microservices-with-python-aws/?referralCode=4727A2957A33ED2E4226)

The purpose of this website is to act as the front-end for a microservices-based Hotel Booking system developed during the courses mentioned above. This straightforward website is designed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It eliminates the complexity of using a more sophisticated JavaScript framework, such as React or Angular, allowing students to focus on learning about Microservices and their development in AWS.

The course explains how a microservices-based system is developed and what relevant design patterns are applied in scenarios.


## Usage

1- Clone the repository into a local folder.

3- Search for "<api url here>" and replace it with the actual URL of the APIs you build.

You will need a web server like Internet Information Services (IIS) in Windows or Apache Tomcat on Mac/Linux. Alternatively, you can use ["Web Server Extension on Google Chrome"](https://bit.ly/3QJF53O)
