# Build Microservices with AWS 
# The Website


This HTML & Javascript website is part of two online courses called ["Build Microservices with .NET and Amazon Web Services"](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-microservices-with-aspnet-core-amazon-web-services/?referralCode=B288BF33506B34292176) and ["Master Event-Driven Microservices with Python and AWS"](https://www.udemy.com/course/build-microservices-with-python-aws/?referralCode=4727A2957A33ED2E4226)

The purpose of this website is to act as the front-end for a microservices-based Hotel Booking system developed during the courses mentioned above. This straightforward website is designed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It eliminates the complexity of using a more sophisticated JavaScript framework, such as React or Angular, allowing students to focus on learning about Microservices and their development in AWS.

The course explains how a microservices-based system is developed and what relevant design patterns are applied in scenarios.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository into a local folder.
2. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Search for "<api url here>" and replace it with the actual URL of the APIs you build.

***You will need a web server, such as Internet Information Services (IIS) in Windows or Apache Tomcat on Mac or Linux.***

A straightforward way to set up a web server is with Node.js's built-in web server. Follow these steps:

1. Download node.js : [https://nodejs.org/en]([url](https://nodejs.org/en))
2. In Terminal, enter `npm --version` to make sure you have Node.js.
3. In Terminal, enter `npm install -g http-server`
4. Clone the front-end Github repository, then "cd" into that directory in Terminal: `cd path/to/your/website`
5. Start the HTTP server: `http-server`
6. Visit `http://localhost:8080` 
7- If port 8080 is occupied on your computer, specify a different port when you start the HTTP server: `http-server -p 3000`
